# Task #1 and #3
There are 5 unit test for main functionality, last test it an example of data driven testing (It may also use and external file).

Task #2
Validation of start and end constructor parameter was using the wrong comparassion operator. I also added an +1 to start parameter, I could handle this in RunFizzBuzz method but just tryed to keep things simple.
